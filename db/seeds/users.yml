       It's been great to meet people and get some creative juices flowing."

        One day i hope to become a pop star. I'm a singer, even though it's mostly in the shower... but I'd like
        to take it to the next level! Finding Jammer has been a gift from above."

        and have always had trouble finding people to jam with. I was in a band back in high school for a bit but
        we didn't play as much as I would've liked to. Genre of choice is heavy metal, I hope there's some metal
        enthusiasts I can jam with and maybe even be friends with haha!"

        to do the same thing but with other people. I'm tired of being a musical loner! Genre of choice would be
        rock but I'm flexible. I've never played with others before so anyone else out there who is a bit shy but with
        some experience would be ideal."

        stuff that I play.  I've taken up keys because I used to play piano back in the day so feel that'd be easiest to
        start off with. Hopefully play some soulful stuff in any venue really. Join my jam if you crave these things too!"

        My focus for the moment is to play guitar with musically like-minded people. If i was to choose a genre to play it'd be rock."

        rise from the ashes that are my life right now. Jammer is the perfect opportunity to casually get back into playing music.
        I hope you join my jam!"
